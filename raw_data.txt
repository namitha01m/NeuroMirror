Today felt like I was running in circles, just endless tasks and no real progress. I'm so tired of feeling stuck.
Got a new project at work and I'm genuinely excited about the challenge. This is exactly what I needed.
I've been thinking a lot about the book I read last week and its central theme. It's complex but fascinating.
